# MLC-for-Android-Malware

We propose a ML-based multi-label classification approach for Android malicious behavior analysis in order to break through the limitation of inaccurate and insufficient information for subsequent analysis, which exists in both binary and family classification. To achieve this, we first summarize 6 types of basic malicious behaviors with an in-depth analysis on 180 malware with security reports. Sepciffly, these 6 labels are ``\textbf{SMS-related}'', ``\textbf{Internet-related}'', ``\textbf{Telephony-related}'', ``\textbf{Lock-in}'', ``\textbf{Ads}'', and ``\textbf{Re-infection}''.

The repository provides .pkl files, test sets and test code, which can be used for reproducing the results of experiments in Multi-label Classification for Android Malware
Based on Active Learning. Table 1 presents the directory structure.
