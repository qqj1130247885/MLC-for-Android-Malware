# MLC-for-Android-Malware

We propose a ML-based multi-label classification approach for Android malicious behavior analysis in order to break through the limitation of inaccurate and insufficient information for subsequent analysis, which exists in both binary and family classification. To achieve this, we first summarize 6 types of basic malicious behaviors with an in-depth analysis on 180 malware with security reports. Sepciffly, these 6 labels are ``\textbf{SMS-related}'', ``\textbf{Internet-related}'', ``\textbf{Telephony-related}'', ``\textbf{Lock-in}'', ``\textbf{Ads}'', and ``\textbf{Re-infection}''.
